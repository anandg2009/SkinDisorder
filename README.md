# SkinDisorder

ðŸ”¸Project Overview:
 In This Project focuses on comparing different machine learning classifiers for predicting skin diseases. The models evaluated include:

1)Logistic Regression
2)K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3)Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
4)Decision Tree Classifier
5)Random Forest Classifier
6)Gradient Boosting Classifier

ðŸ”¸Analysis Highlights:
1) The models are evaluated on both training and test data, with accuracy being the primary metric.
2) Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers performed well, balancing both training and test set accuracy.
3) KNN and Gradient Boosting also showed competitive performance, although slightly lower in accuracy.

ðŸ”¸Challenges Identified:
1) Class Imbalance: Imbalanced class distribution affects model performance, especially on rare skin disorders.
2) Specificity for Rare Classes: Models struggle with rare conditions like Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris due to limited data.
3)Interpretability: Understanding misclassifications and making the models interpretable for healthcare professionals is critical.

ðŸ”¸Conclusion:
These models offer valuable tools for early identification and diagnosis of skin diseases, improving healthcare outcomes. The choice of a model can be adjusted based on specific needs and prevalent skin conditions in the target population.
